# NoScroll
A Chrome extension that reminds users to complete their highest priority tasks on a todo list to prevent doomscrolling.

To add this extension to your browser. Clone this repository to your desktop, visit chrome://extensions, go to the top right and turn on developer mode, click "Load unpacked", and add the NoScroll file.

This extension currently only works for 30 minute intervals and does not support changing the priority of tasks without deleting them, but they will be added later on.
